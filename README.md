# Getting start

​	The [main.py]() file contain the main experiments of our paper. 

​	For the first step, you should change the path in the [main.py]() file according to your environment.

​    We provide some checkpoints of our model and you can download them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-oEe1F_-OqkWoeYOtyOGJLiGJskLbcyX?usp=sharing).

​	After download the checkpoints, you can directly run the [main.py]() file to evaluate the performance of the JSCC system and the joint JSCC and CDDM system at an SNR of 10 dB under the AWGN channel.

​	The code about training has been annotated, but the related code has been contained in the project, you can run the function directly.
